# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project
This project uses Excel to analyze Kickstarter campaign data. The data is used to visualize campaign outcomes based on their funding goals and launch dates.

### Purpose
Louise, our client, wants to maximize her opportunity to run a successful crowdfunding campaign. The Kickstarter data concentrated on the factors of failed, canceled, and successful play (theatre) campaigns. The data was analyzed to illustrate trends that show the relationship between the launch dates and fundraising goals on a campaignâ€™s outcome.This analysis was performed by using Excel's formula functionalities, data filtering, and visualization tools.
